## Introduction

The Career Recommendation Chatbot is an innovative AI-driven solution designed to provide personalized career guidance to individuals seeking direction in their professional journey. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, this chatbot aims to offer tailored recommendations based on users' unique interests, skills, educational background, and employment status.

## Main Points

### Model Fine-Tuning
The core of the chatbot lies in its utilization of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), specifically LaMDA 2, which has been fine-tuned on a specialized career recommendation dataset. This fine-tuning process enhances the model's ability to understand and generate relevant career suggestions based on user inputs.

### Input Parameters
Users engage with the chatbot by providing various parameters such as their interests, skills, level of education, and current employment status. These inputs serve as crucial data points that inform the chatbot's recommendation engine, enabling it to generate tailored career advice.

### Output Recommendation
Upon receiving user inputs, the chatbot employs the fine-tuned LaMDA 2 model to generate personalized career recommendations. These recommendations are based on the user's profile information and are aimed at suggesting suitable career paths aligned with their interests and qualifications.

### Format for LLM (LaMDA 2)
The input format for the LaMDA 2 model follows a conversational dialogue structure, where users interact with the chatbot by providing their information and posing queries related to career suggestions. This conversational approach enhances user engagement and facilitates a more intuitive interaction process.

### Fine-Tuning Process
To optimize model performance and efficiency, the fine-tuning process is conducted in carefully managed chunks. By breaking down the dataset into manageable segments, the chatbot's training process is streamlined, leading to improved accuracy and responsiveness in generating career recommendations.

### Real-World Application
The Career Recommendation Chatbot holds significant potential in real-world scenarios, serving as a valuable resource for individuals navigating their career paths. Whether for students exploring future career options, professionals seeking career advancement, or individuals considering a career change, this chatbot offers actionable insights and guidance tailored to each user's specific circumstances.

## Key Details

### Career Recommendation Dataset.
The fine-tuning of the LaMDA 2 model relies on a comprehensive career recommendation dataset. This dataset contains a wealth of information, including user interests, skills, educational backgrounds, and corresponding career trajectories, enabling the chatbot to provide informed and relevant recommendations.

### Gradient API
To access and fine-tune the LaMDA 2 model effectively, the project leverages the Gradient API. This API provides seamless integration with cloud-based resources, facilitating the training process and ensuring optimal utilization of computational resources.

### Chunk Size
To mitigate the risk of overloading the model and ensure efficient training, the dataset is divided into manageable chunks. This approach allows for better control over the training process, enabling the chatbot to learn from diverse data samples while maintaining performance and stability.
